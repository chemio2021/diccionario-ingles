<p><b>Job's comforter</b> (johbz KUM-fuhr-tuhr) noun<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A person who tries to console or help someone who not only fails but ends<br>
up making the person feel worse.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[Originally there was not just one, but three Job's comforters. In the<br>
Biblical story these people tried to console Job, an upright person, that<br>
his troubles must be divine retribution for his sins.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
There are Job's comforters in current times as well: soon after any disaster<br>
these TV preachers are ready to explain how the afflicted had offended gods<br>
and brought it upon themselves.]<br>

&quot;Parting with my son William this past June was difficult. He was going<br>
abroad to study language for two semesters.<br>
'I don't know why I feel so sad,' I told my husband. 'I just feel as if<br>
he is going to the other side of the world.'<br>
'He is,' said my husband in his role as Job's comforter. 'That's where<br>
China is.'&quot;<br>
