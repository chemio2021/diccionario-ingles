&nbsp; &quot;Act now while the supply lasts, and you can buy a rare facsimile of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 11th-century, illuminated German manuscript for only $16,425. After<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; March 15, the price will rise to $19,205. This is what the publisher<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; has told prospective German buyers interested in acquiring a 410-page,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gilded copy of a pericope.&quot;<br>
