  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>After Deolali, a small town in western India. It's about 100 miles from 
Mumbai with an unusual claim to fame. It's where British soldiers who had 
completed their tour of duty were sent to await transportation home. It was a 
long wait -- often many months -- before they were to be picked up by ships to 
take them to England. Consequent boredom, and heat, turned many a soldier insane, 
and the word doolally was coined. At least that's the story.<br>
More likely, soldiers who were going soft in the head were sent to the 
sanatorium there. At first the term was used in the form &quot;He's got the Doo-lally 
tap&quot;, from Sanskrit tapa (heat) meaning one has caught doolally fever but now 
it's mostly heard as in &quot;to go doolally&quot;. In Australia, they say &quot;Calm down, 
don't do your lolly&quot;. </p>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys 
the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today. -John F. Kennedy, 
35th US president (1917-1963) </p>
