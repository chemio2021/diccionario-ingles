<p><b>Roscian</b> (ROSH-ee-uhn) adjective<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of or related to acting.<br>
<br>
[After Quintus Roscius Gallus (c.126-62 BCE), a Roman actor famous for his<br>
talent in acting.]<br>
<br>
Roscius was born in slavery but his success on stage won him freedom from<br>
the dictator Sulla. He was considered the greatest comic actor and Cicero<br>
took elocution lessons from him. Cicero later returned the favor by<br>
defending him in a lawsuit and the defense speech survives to this day.<br>
In his honor, accomplished actors are sometimes called Roscius.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; attracting my attention, I opened it and found it to be the playbill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; I had received from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of Roscian renown.&quot;<br>
