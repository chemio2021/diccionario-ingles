<p><b>Carbon-neutral </b>(KAHR-buhn NOO-truhl, NYOO-) adjective<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Adding no net carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
[A greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide is a contributor to global<br>
warming. Carbon-neutral means contributing zero total emission of the gas<br>
into the atmosphere. The earliest citation of the term is found in a 1992<br>
article in The Independent (London, UK).]<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Being carbon-neutral doesn't necessarily mean producing zero carbon dioxide.<br>
What it means is that the net addition is zero, offset by other actions,<br>
such as planting trees, buying clean energy, etc. And it doesn't have to be<br>
all or nothing. If you cannot be completely carbon-neutral, you can definitely<br>
reduce your carbon footprint.<br>
