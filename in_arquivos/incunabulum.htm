<p><b>Incunabulum</b> (in-kyoo-NAB-yuh-luhm) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A book printed during the infancy of printing, especially one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; produced before 1501.<br>
<br>
[From Latin incunabula (swaddling clothes, cradle), from cunae (cradle,<br>
infancy). Ultimately from the Indo-European root kei- (to lie, bed, dear)<br>
that is also the source of such words as city, cemetery, and Sanskrit<br>
shiva.]<br>
<br>
Imagine a newly-born book, swaddled in clothes. Etymology often shows<br>
the poetry of words. Gutenberg operated his pioneering printing press<br>
during the 1450s. Books printed during that time are known as incunabula<br>
though the term can be applied to any work of art or industry from its<br>
early period.<br>

&nbsp; &quot;The last public sale of a more or less complete copy of 'The Canterbury<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tales' went to J. Paul Getty's Wormsley Library in 1998 for $4.2 million.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; We are thus assured that a strong financial incentive remains to preserve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; intact incunabula.&quot;<br>
