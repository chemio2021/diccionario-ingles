  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Antonioni is probably best known for Blow-Up, a nubilous 1966 drama set in 
swinging London about a fashion photographer who comes to believe that a 
photograph he took of two lovers in a public park also shows, hidden in the 
background, evidence of a murder.&quot;<br>
Rick Lyman; Michelangelo Antonioni, Subversive Filmmaker; International Herald 
Tribune (Paris, France); August 1, 2007. </p>
<p>&quot;All of which nubilous musing serves little purpose, except to show that 
cloud-gazing, as a way of passing time, has appealed to all humanity since the 
earliest of times.&quot;<br>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>A time will come when a politician who has wilfully made war and promoted 
international dissension will be as sure of the dock and much surer of the noose 
than a private homicide. It is not reasonable that those who gamble with men's 
lives should not stake their own. -H.G. Wells, writer (1866-1946)</p>
