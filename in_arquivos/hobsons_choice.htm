	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">MEANING:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><i style="font-style: italic">noun</i>: An 
apparently free choice that offers no real alternative. <br>
&nbsp;</font><div style="font-family: Verdana; color: #aaaaaa; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">ETYMOLOGY:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">After Thomas Hobson (1544?-1630), English 
keeper of a livery stable, from his requirement that customers take either the 
horse nearest the stable door or none. <br>
&nbsp;</font><div style="font-family: Verdana; color: #aaaaaa; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">NOTES:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Hobson had some 40 animals in his rent-a-horse 
business and a straightforward system: a returning horse goes to the end of the 
line, and the horse at the top of the line gets to serve next. He had good 
intentions -- rotating horses so his steeds received good rest and an equal wear, 
but his heavy-handed enforcement of the policy didn't earn him any customer 
service stars. He could have offered his clients the option of choosing one of 
the two horses nearest the stable door, for instance, and still achieve nearly 
the same goal. More recently Henry Ford offered customers a Ford Model T in any 
color as long as it was black. <br>
