&nbsp; &quot;In the April 1945 Catholic Worker, Janet Kalven of the Granville<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Agricultural School for Women in Loveland, Ohio called for 'an education<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; that will give young women a vision of the family as the vital cell of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the social organism, and that will inspire them with the great ambitions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; of being queens in the home.' By which she did not mean a sequacious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; helpmeet to the Man of the House, picking up his dirty underwear and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; serving him Budweisers during commercials.&quot;<br>
