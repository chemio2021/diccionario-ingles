  MEANING:</div>
<p><i style="font-style: italic">noun:</i><br>
1. Any of several fishes of the family Echeneididae that have a dorsal fin 
modified in the shape of a suction disk that they use to attach to a larger fish, 
sea-turtles, or ships.<br>
Also called sharksucker or suckerfish.<br>
2. Hindrance, drag.</p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>From Latin, literally delay, from remorari (to linger, delay), from re- + 
morari (to delay), from mora (delay). </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  NOTES:</div>
<p>&quot;Demur&quot; and &quot;moratorium&quot; are other words that share the same root as remora. 
They all involve the idea of delay. Remora got their name from the belief that 
they slowed ships down by attaching themselves to the hull. Remora's suction 
power is so strong that, in some parts of the world, lines are attached to their 
tails and lowered into the water to fish for sea turtles. </p>
<p>Remora eat scraps from the fish they attach to. But they don't just get a 
free ride and free food. It's a symbiotic relationship as they, in turn, remove 
parasites from their bigger buddies. </p>

  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Ryder has been a remora to the Heathers but boils over and, with Slater's 
crucial aid, kills one kind of accidentally.&quot;<br>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>All the arguments to prove man's superiority cannot shatter this hard fact: 
in suffering the animals are our equals. -Peter Singer, philosopher, professor 
of bioethics (b. 1946)</p>
