<p><b>Paraph</b> (PAR-uhf, puh-RAF) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A flourish at the end of a signature, originally as a precaution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; against forgery.<br>
<br>
[Via French and Latin from Greek paragraphos (a line showing a break<br>
in sense or a change of speakers), from para- (beside) + graphein (write).<br>
Ultimately from the Indo-European root gerbh- (to scratch), which also<br>
gave us crab, crayfish, carve, crawl, grammar, anagram, program, and<br>
graphite.]<br>

&nbsp; &quot;This was a considerable feat in that he had recognised not only the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; initial upon the bedcloth, but its unique paraph in one corner.&quot;<br>
