  MEANING:</div>
<p><i style="font-style: italic">noun:</i> A foolish or futile activity. </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>From mug (slang for a fool), from Scandinavian word mugg/mugge (drinking cup). 
In earlier times drinking cups were adorned with grotesque faces, which resulted 
in the various senses of the word, nouns (face, dupe, thug) and verbs (to 
assault, to make faces, to photograph). </p>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>I died as a mineral and became a plant, I died as plant and rose to animal, I 
died as animal and I was Man. Why should I fear? When was I less by dying? -Jalaluddin 
Rumi, poet and mystic (1207-1273) </p>
