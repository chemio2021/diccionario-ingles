  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>Shakespeare wrote in The Merchant of Venice, &quot;All that glisters is not gold.&quot; 
Fool's gold is another name for pyrite, also known as iron pyrite or iron 
sulfide. Its shiny yellow luster has many fooled into believing they have struck 
gold while holding a mineral of little value.<br>
The name pyrite is from Greek pyrites (of fire), from pyr (fire) because it 
produces sparks when struck against a hard surface. Some related words are fire, 
pyre, pyrosis (heartburn), pyromania (an irresistible impulse to set things on 
fire), and empyreal (relating to the sky or heaven, believed to contain pure 
light or fire.). </p>

  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Although the old rust-belt industries of the 20th century had to go, Britain 
turned its back on industry rather too readily. We were bedazzled by financial 
services: fool's gold from the City.&quot;<br>

UK); Jan 24, 2009. </p>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>I have always found that mercy bears richer fruits than strict justice.
