	NOTES:</div>
When you throw a die, you don't count the number of pips to determine the value 
of the throw. You subitize. Now here's a word you want to use when you take part

subitizing capability range from four to seven. Subitizing also depends on the 
arrangement of the objects. Try this subitizing

	USAGE:</div>
&quot;Brian Butterworth's explanation focuses on our uncanny ability to subitise. Up 
to four or five objects, most people can tell how many there are just by 
looking, without counting each one. But if there are more objects, we have to 
count.&quot;<br>

&quot;Getting the computer model to subitize the way humans and animals did was 
possible, Stanislas Dehaene found, only if he built in 'number neurons'.&quot;<br>
