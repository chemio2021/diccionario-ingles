  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>After Samuel Pickwick, a character in the novel Pickwick Papers (serialized 
1836-1837) by Charles Dickens. Mr Pickwick is known for his simplicity and 
kindness. In the novel Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Blotton call each other names and it 
appears later that they were using the offensive words only in a Pickwickian 
sense and had the highest regard for each other.<br>
Another term that arose from the book is Pickwickian syndrome, which refers to a 
combination of interlinked symptoms such as extreme obesity, shallow breathing, 
tiredness, sleepiness, etc. The character with these symptoms was not Mr. 
Pickwick, but Fat Joe, so the term is really coined after the book's title. The 
medical term for the condition is obesity-hypoventilation syndrome. </p>
