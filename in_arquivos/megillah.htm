<p><b>Megillah</b> (meh-GIL-uh) noun<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A long, tedious account.<br>
<br>
[From Yiddish megile (scroll), from Hebrew megillah, from galal (to roll).<br>
The term alludes to the length of the text in the Book of Esther which<br>
is read in its entirety, twice, during Purim, a Jewish festival.]<br>

<br>
&nbsp; &quot;But the obvious challenge was to go through the whole megillah -- to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; begin with the Andante in C Major, which Mozart wrote when he was 
five,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and proceed to the bitter end, the Requiem.&quot;<br>
