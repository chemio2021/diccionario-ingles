[From Latin jugulatus, past participle of jugulare (to cut the throat),<br>

from the Indo-European root yeug- (to join) that is also the ancestor<br>
of such words as junction, yoke, yoga, adjust, juxtapose, and junta.]<br>

&nbsp; &quot;As Douglas Hurd, who refused to sign the letter, could see full well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; this is not an attempt to change Tory policy on the single European<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; currency. It is an attempt to jugulate William Hague.&quot;<br>
