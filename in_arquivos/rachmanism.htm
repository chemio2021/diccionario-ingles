  MEANING:</div>
<p><i style="font-style: italic">noun:</i> The exploitation and intimidation of 
tenants by landlords. </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>After Peter Rachman (1919-1962), a landlord in London who became notorious 
for unethical practices including driving out tenants to maximize revenue from 
his rental properties. Another fellow who got his name in the dictionary for 
harassing tenants is Charles Boycott (1832-1897), a British land agent in 
Ireland, whose mistreatment of tenants resulted in his getting ostracized, i.e. 
he was boycotted. </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;It is a story of pure Rachmanism. She had been threatened, had her rent 
cheque refused, her electricity cut off, and seen her absent neighbours' flats 
cleared of all their possessions, while rubbish was dumped outside her door.&quot;<br>
