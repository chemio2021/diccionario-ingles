	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">MEANING:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4"><i style="font-style: italic">adjective:</i> 
Of or relating to a marriage between two people of different social ranks such 
that the spouse of lower rank and the children do not share the titles or 
possessions of the higher-ranking spouse. <br>
&nbsp;</font><div style="font-family: Verdana; color: #aaaaaa; font-weight: bold">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">ETYMOLOGY:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">From Latin matrimonium ad morganaticam (marriage 
with a morning gift), implying that the gift given on the morning after the 
marriage was the only gift received by the wife. It was also known as a left-handed 
marriage because the groom held his bride's hand with his left (instead of right) 
hand. The word is of Germanic origin (morgen: morning, e.g. guten morgen: good 
morning). From a word for 'morning' to a word for a kind of marriage, that's an 
example of the idiosyncratic ways languages evolve. <br>
&nbsp;</font><div style="font-family: Verdana; color: #aaaaaa; font-weight: bold">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">USAGE:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&quot;Nicholas [Sheremetev] was severely 
punished by society and his friends for his morganatic marriage, which was 
regarded as class treason.&quot;<br>
