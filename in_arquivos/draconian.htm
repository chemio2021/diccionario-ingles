	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">ETYMOLOGY:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">After Draco (late 7th century BCE), 
Athenian legislator, noted for the harshness of his code of laws. <br>
&nbsp;</font><div style="font-family: Verdana; color: #aaaaaa; font-size: 13px; font-weight: bold">
	<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">NOTES:</font></div>
<font face="Times New Roman" size="4">Under Draco's laws even trivial offenses,

<br>
When it comes to lawmaking, the name of one of Draco's successors has entered 
the language in an opposite sense. The Athenian lawmaker Solon's reform to make 
Draco's laws humane earned him a place in the dictionary as an eponym meaning &quot;a 
wise lawgiver&quot;. It was Solon who said: Laws are the spider's webs which, if 
anything small falls into them they ensnare it, but large things break through 
and escape. <br>
