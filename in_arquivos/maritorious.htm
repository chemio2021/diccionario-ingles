<h3>Maritorious </h3>
<p>As we head towards equality of the sexes, the same word works fine for both. 
Today one who teaches is simply a teacher, compared to earlier days when we had 
teachers and teacheresses, depending on their anatomy. This is a good thing: why 
have two separate words when a person's gender has no bearing on the job? But 
sometimes separate words are necessary to convey a distinction. This week we'll 
feature five words that relate specifically to either men or women, and we'll 
also include words for him or for her. </p>

  MEANING:</div>
<p><i style="font-style: italic">adjective:</i> Excessively fond of one's 
husband. </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>From Latin maritus (married, husband). </p>
<div style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px; color: #aaaaaa; font-family: Verdana">
  NOTES:</div>
<p>The word to describe a husband who is excessively fond of a wife is uxorious. 
The word maritorious is rare, while uxorious is fairly well known. What does 
that say about the relative fondness of husbands and wives to each other? </p>
