  ETYMOLOGY:</div>
<p>From Latin irascibilis (quick to anger), from irasci (to grow angry), from

also the source of irate, ire, hierarchy, hieroglyphic, and estrogen. </p>

  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Mr. Weir concludes from his large experience that the erection of the 
feathers is caused much more by anger than by fear. He gives as an instance a 
hybrid goldfinch of a most irascible disposition, which when approached too 
closely by a servant, instantly assumes the appearance of a ball of ruffled 
feathers.&quot;<br>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>Myth: we have to save the earth. Frankly, the earth doesn't need to be saved. 
Nature doesn't give a hoot if human beings are here or not. The planet has 
survived cataclysmic and catastrophic changes for millions upon millions of 
years. Over that time, it is widely believed, 99 percent of all species have 
come and gone while the planet has remained. Saving the environment is really 
about saving our environment - making it safe for ourselves, our children, and 
the world as we know it. If more people saw the issue as one of saving 
themselves, we would probably see increased motivation and commitment to 
actually do so. -Robert M. Lilienfeld, management consultant and author (b. 
1953) and William L. Rathje, archaeologist and author (b. 1945) </p>
