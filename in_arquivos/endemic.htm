  USAGE:</div>
<p>&quot;Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage 
of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official 
corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but 
deliver totalitarianism. Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of 
movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public 
trust.&quot;<br>

  A THOUGHT FOR TODAY:</div>
<p>Patriotism is proud of a country's virtues and eager to correct its 
deficiencies; it also acknowledges the legitimate patriotism of other countries, 
with their own specific virtues. The pride of nationalism, however, trumpets its 
country's virtues and denies its deficiencies, while it is contemptuous toward 
the virtues of other countries. It wants to be, and proclaims itself to be, &quot;the 
greatest&quot;, but greatness is not required of a country; only goodness is. -Sydney 
J. Harris, journalist and author (1917-1986)</p>
